# **_Stop maintain_** #

ChmSee is not being developed anymore.

I haven't read CHM documents more than a year, new and update IT books are pdfs or epubs, so it's right time to end this chm viewer.

# Intro #

ChmSee is an HTML Help viewer for Unix/Linux.

Build and installing instruction located in tarball's README.md, you can also view this file at https://github.com/jungleji/chmsee/blob/master/README.md
